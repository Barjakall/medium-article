      <h2>Just some title</h2>
      <p>Avocados are a fruit, not a vegetable. They're technically considered a single-seeded berry, believe it or not. Once again..
        Avocados are a fruit, not a vegetable. They're technically considered a single-seeded berry, believe it or not.. one more time..

      <h2>Is this a second title?</h2>
      <p>There's a fruit that tastes like chocolate pudding. Can we get in on this?

      <h2>Perhaps.. the last title</h2>
      <p>Japan has over 200 flavours of Kit Kats. They're exclusively created for different regions, cities, and seasons.
        There are some tasty-sounding ones like banana, blueberry cheesecake and Oreo ice cream, as well as some very questionable ones
        like baked potato, melon and cheese, wasabi, and vegetable juice.</p>
